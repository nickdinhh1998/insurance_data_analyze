Hello data lovers,

For those of you are new to data projects, insurance data analysis is unskippable section. There are many companies and corporations recruiting data analysts
for insurance fields out there. For sure that their data would be much more complicated than the insurance.csv file you find here. But this could help you understand
what scopes are and which of them are needed when you do a data analysis on insurance files. 

I am just now Entry Level, so my scopes for this data file could not be professional or enough. I am really appreciated those who contribute their thoughts
about scopes of this file.
